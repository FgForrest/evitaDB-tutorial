# Tutorial for evitaDB

This repository contains a Java tutorial demonstrating how to connect, query, and update an evitaDB database.
Each example is contained in a `Main` class in the `src/main/java/io/evitadb/tutorial` directory and can be executed
by running `main` method of the class.

Each example assumes that an instance of the evitaDB database is running on the same machine and exposes the web APIs
on standard ports 5555, 5556 and 5557.

Each example is located in its own branch and is numbered as sequence of chapter number, followed by a dot, followed by
the example number. For example, the first example of chapter 2 is located in branch `02.01-name-of-the-example`. For
running the example you'll need Java 17 or higher. We recommend executing the examples from your IDE so that you can
place breakpoints and inspect the code.
